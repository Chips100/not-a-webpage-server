[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Chips100/not-a-webpage-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Chips100/not-a-webpage-server)

This is totally just a minimalistic webserver to host not-a-webpage. It is implemented with NodeJS and as of now, it just serves static files from a subdirectory.
